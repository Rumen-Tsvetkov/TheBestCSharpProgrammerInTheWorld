# The Best C# Programmer In The World - Benjamin Perkins

I wanted to execute a Search Engine Optimization project some years ago and decided one action to take was to register the domain name thebestcsharpprogrammerintheworld.com. My objective was to have my blog be the first link when someone entered: "Who is the best C# programmer in the world". I can say that it worked out pretty good as my blog does usually show first when that phrase is searched for. In reality I just like to code and like to share C# code examples. But...when you ask a search engine a question, isn't it always assumed to be correct? :-)
Happy coding and take a look at my blog if you want at http://www.thebestcsharpprogrammerintheworld.com
